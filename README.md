## About The Project

You want to automate processes? That's what this repo is for :)

## Getting Started

### Initializing Repos
Execute the [repo_creater](repo_creator.sh) in the direcotry where you want to create a new repository. 

It takes the following arguments:
- Github username
- Repo name
- Github token

This what's going to happen:

- new directory is created if it doesn't already exist
- git repo is initialised
- repo is created on github and added as remote,
- readme file is created 
- first commit is made.
